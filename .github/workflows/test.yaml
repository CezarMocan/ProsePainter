  # Separating out the build and test phase since we were running into out
  # of memory errors trying to build and test on the same runner. This will
  # be a bit slower though since you'll need to push and pull a large container.

  # Really what we need to do is set up dedicated workers that can have more memory
  # and disk space, and keep a persistent cache of docker layers from run to run.
